# BTech-CSE-AIML-ML-Lab-SEM-3
Collection of Machine Learning experiments demonstrating core ML concepts and algorithms during Semester III lab sessions.




This repository contains the implementation of core **Machine Learning experiments** as part of the B.Tech CSE (AI & ML) curriculum.  
All experiments are implemented using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks**, with appropriate datasets included wherever required.

 📌 Experiments Included

1. **Dataset Exploration**
   - Load and explore datasets (e.g., Iris, MNIST) using Pandas
   - Compute summary statistics and basic data insights

2. **Train–Validation Split**
   - Split datasets into training and validation/test sets
   - Implemented using `train_test_split`

3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from Scratch**
   - Implemented KNN algorithm without using built-in classifiers
   - Applied on the Iris dataset
   - Observed accuracy variation with different values of K

4. **Linear Regression**
   - Trained a linear regression model on the Boston Housing dataset
   - Visualized residuals vs. predicted values

5. **Logistic Regression for Spam Detection**
   - Built a logistic regression classifier
   - Used text data for spam vs. ham classification
   - Evaluated performance using **Precision–Recall curves**

6. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Optimization**
   - Optimized SVM hyperparameters (C and kernel)
   - Used Grid Search on a synthetic dataset

7. **Confusion Matrix & F1-Score**
   - Computed confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Applied to a diabetes prediction dataset

8. **ROC Curve & AUC Comparison**
   - Plotted ROC curves for binary classification
   - Compared AUC scores of different algorithms
